# RULES OF NAMING A VARIABLE

# 1. VARIABLES NAMES MUST START WITH A LETTER OR AN UNDERSCORE LIKE _PRODUCT, PRODUCT_
# 2. THE REMAINDER OF YOUR VARIABLE NAME MAY CONSIST OF LETTERS,NUMBERS AND UNDERSCORES
# 3. SPACY1, pyThon, machine_learning are some valid names
# 4. case_sensitive, CASE_SENSiTIVE and Case_Sensitive are each a different variable
# 5. It's a best practice to create a variable that should be coherent with the context
#     you are working with fruit data; the variable name should be "fruit" or "fruit_mango".
